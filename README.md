## <a name="introduction">Problem Statement | Introduction</a>
In India, it's hard for people to find and get legal help because legal professionals work independently and there's a need for a centralised platform to connect with them easily. 
So This project is a user-friendly, secure, and transparent functional prototype of an e-marketplace platform for Legal Service Providers and citizens of India which addresses the following challenges :
- Getting Legal Professionals on the Board
- Making Services Transparent 
- Service Quality Control
- Matching Clients with the Right Professional
- Accessible to Everyone
The platform will also integrate with the Bar Council association and other courts to verify the legal service providers in future.
